My name is Kiran Jorwekar, Iam having almost 21 years of IT experience. I am currently working in a MNC company as a SCS having IT Project Management role and responsibilities along with Scrum Master Role.

I love learning new technology and latest trends in IT that helps me to do something new in my project area which benefits my workplace and I learn that too with it! :-)

I am currently learning - AI ML from Abhinav Venkat (https://www.linkedin.com/in/abbhinavvenkat/), so will continue to update my github space and keep updating my learning / sample code here.

In this last year I learned Appian (Low code - No code) platform and using that I have completed "Parking Genie" - solution to office parking space. This was my topic for hackethon and surprising with this #innovative idea, we (me and my team) had won the first prize. 
This application development was a grat experience and help to learn a lot of things while completing this application within 1 week's of effort.

This gives me a great 'Design Thinking' capabilities and based on that starting of this year 2024, I have completed "Design Thinking Practioner" certification, a great lernaing and design expereince, a step towards to Architect role.

Will keep updating this space going further.

Thank You!
